## 📝 Project Context
Students in the Business Analysis Program (BAP) faced difficulties securing co-op placements due to perceived gaps in technical proficiency and high market competition. I co-led a team to validate these assumptions through structured research.

## 🕵️ Data & Methodology
We conducted a requirements analysis involving three key stakeholder groups:
1.  **Current Students (n=19):** To gauge satisfaction and confidence.
2.  **Career Coaches (n=3):** To understand support structures.
3.  **Alumni (n=3):** To identify industry realities.

## 💡 Key Insights
* **Service Gap:** **63.2%** of students expressed dissatisfaction with current career services, specifically citing a lack of mock interview prep.
* **Curriculum Gap:** 90% of alumni respondents identified **Data Analysis** and **Adaptability** as the most critical missing skills in the curriculum.
* **Demand:** 84.2% of students requested more robust internship and co-op programs.

## 🚀 Recommendations
Based on the analysis, our team proposed:
1.  **Mentorship Program:** Connecting current students with alumni to bridge the "industry awareness" gap.
2.  **Technical Upskilling:** Integrating more hands-on tools into the curriculum to meet employer demand.
3.  **Partnerships:** Expanding industry ties to increase co-op seat availability.
