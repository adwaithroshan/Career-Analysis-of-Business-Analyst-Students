# Career-Analysis-of-Business-Analyst-Students

## Overview
This project explored the challenges faced by students in NorQuest College’s Business Analysis Program (BAP) in securing co-op opportunities. The study highlighted two main barriers:  
1. A perceived lack of technical proficiency in business analysis.  
2. High competitiveness with students from other Edmonton-based institutions.  

As program participants ourselves, we conducted a structured investigation into these challenges and proposed strategies to improve co-op experiences and career outcomes for students.  

## Objectives
- Identify difficulties students face in securing co-op placements.  
- Analyze the effectiveness of existing career services and study materials.  
- Collect insights from alumni, career coaches, and current students.  
- Recommend actionable improvements to enhance job readiness and co-op outcomes.
